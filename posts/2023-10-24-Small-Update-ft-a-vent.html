      <p>Hi! It has been a small bit since the last blog, isn't it? I am still fine thank you. I've been playing Super Mario Bros. Wonder recently and it's an excellent game! But that's for another time.</p>

      <p>(Note: 100% it is actually not that impressive.)</p>
      <br>
      <p>Yep that's the end of the the update, now onto the following subject, my art.</p>
      <p>As you might know, it's been since the October of 2022 I've started doing art seriously. Now it has been a year since then. Have I felt I've improved since then?</p>
      <p>Yes! And by a lot in my opinion. However I have felt a sense of stagnation recently, whereas I felt like I was improving everyday.</p>
      <p>It kinda leaves me empty inside, I know I can do better, but I don't know how. I have a clear goal in mind, and I want to reach it.</p>
      <p>When I look at my art, I think it looks good, but I don't really feel any accomplishement about it. I don't tell myself <em>"Wow, what I made was really good!"</em> nowadays.</p>
      <p>My art can get better if I spent more than 2 hours doing shit, but if I have nothing to practice, nothing to hone, to learn, what's the point of drawing at the end?</p>
      <br>
      <p>My biggest fear as an artist is to know that I've reached my peak, that I won't be able to do any better.</p>
